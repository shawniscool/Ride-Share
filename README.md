#Swat Ride Share
Swat Ride Share is an online platform created by Swarthmore students Shawn Pand and Terry Kusunoki-Martin to allow Swarthmore students to find others to share rides to/from the airport during the school break. Terry and I spent roughly 12 hours creating the prototype and were able to launch it within 3 days. During the first week of launch, we were able to generate 500 unique visits from a total of 1500 Swarthmore students, and had more than 300 unique posts for the upcoming spring break. 

Unfortunately, as Terry and I have been busy with other projects, we were unable to continue the maintainance.

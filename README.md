#Swat Ride Share
By Swarthmore Students Shawn Pan'17 and Terry Kusunoki-Martin'17
=========

This website is built by Shawn and Terry to create a platform for Swarthmore students to find
others to share rides to/from the airport for the spring break'15. We are looking into creating 
more features, such as user login and email verification, before the summer break when more
traffic will be generated.
